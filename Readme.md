# Coding Challenge

We are helping thousands of landlords manage a property portfolio valued in the billions. A healthy return can be gained if investments are made wisely. Our landlords find it extremely useful to compare their properties against others on the market. Smart landlords know how much revenue properties similar to theirs are making on the same street.

## Task

Your task is to build a simple rental yield calculator so that landlords can work out the yearly yield from renting a property.

We want to collect the following details: 

* Email address
* Phone number 
* Postal code
* Current rent
* Initial cost of buying the property

We would like to see:

* Clean and intuitive design
* Yearly yield return
* Intelligent error handling

For bonus points try to include any additional information such as comparison between the landlord's property and similar ones around it, in the results page and potentially a downloadable pdf. This data might be acquired via 3rd party APIs or published government data.

## Delivery

Please post your code to a GitHub repo, also if you wish a demo can be published using a free Heroku account.
